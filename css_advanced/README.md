Honestly After the first week I thought I was doing pretty good and Everything looked like it was gonna be crossing T's and dotting i's for week two. My expectations were shattered. I felt completly out of control of most of the elements on my page. The entire header is a position mess. And the tutorial section is missing the play buttons and the stars have given me nightmares It's late on wednesday and I've had so many issues just finding time to work on this. I'm throwing my hands up and taking this one on the chin. Moving foward I need to be better about asking for help. 

I dunno this is allot.
